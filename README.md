# Hollys Books

Website I built for a creative writer.\
Stack of books is lying around horizontal as if it was in my sleeping room.\
Each book links to one of Holly Fletcher's published poems to external sites.\
Responsiveness at smartphone devices, showing the books in vertical stack.\
Clicking on "about" shows Fletcher's short biography and an image of herself built with an onclick event function.\
Links to Twitter, Instagram, Mailto by clicking on its images.
